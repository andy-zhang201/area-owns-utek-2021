#How to Run the Python Files
For question 1a, run file "1a.py".
For question 1b, run file "1b.py".
For question 2, run file "question2.py". "pathfinding.py" contains the functions we used to (attempt to) implement Dijkstra's Algorithm.

For questions 3 and 4, we insist you use your imagination to evaluate our code :)
